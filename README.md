# strapi-provider-upload-local-url

## 🚀 &nbsp; _Overview and Motivation_

This provider reflects the `strapi-provider-upload-local`  but with an additional option to set de `baseurl` on upload url data as prefix.

Generally the provider-upload-local is used for development purposes and other providers already implements the a baseurl of the provided solution, this provider just prevents refactoring when changes from deveopment environment to staging/production environments.

    upload: {

        baseurl: "http://localhost:1337"
      },
    },
  })
};
```
